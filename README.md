# Project II - Programming for Data Analysis

## Outline for the project:

- Load and explore the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset using Pandas and Seaborn. This includes checking for missing values, identifying the data types, and getting some summary statistics.

- Perform a statistical analysis of the dataset. This could include examining the distribution of the different features, calculating correlations between features, and testing for statistical significance.

- Split the dataset into training and test sets, and use a range of machine learning algorithms from SKLearn to train classifiers. These could include logistic regression, decision trees, support vector machines, and so on.

- Evaluate the classification performance of the different classifiers using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

- Fine-tune the parameters of the classifiers using cross-validation and grid search, and compare the results to the default parameter values. Explain your rationale for the parameter selections you made.

- Compare, contrast, and critique your results with reference to the literature. This could include discussing any similarities or differences with previous studies, and identifying any limitations or strengths of your approach.

- Discuss and investigate how the dataset could be extended using data synthesis techniques such as bootstrapping or synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE). Explain the potential benefits and drawbacks of these approaches.
